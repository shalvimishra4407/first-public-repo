Note : we can use print_r() and var_dump() to print the output of the array.

print_r(): prints the array or any resource in , readable form it only show the data inside it.

var_dump() : it will dump the entire data about the variable, hence var_dump show the data, called meta data.

var_export: Alias of var_dump(), same as var_dump but it show the representation of the data in more
 readable , not meta data.
 
 empty definition:- a empty is a value (with no value) having type as string and length as zero , and ordinality 
 (ascii) as 0.
 
 what is the major different b/w null and undefined variables?
 1. $x='a'; isset($x)---->return true
 2. echo $x;-print ---- a
 
 if you try these things with a undefined variable.
$y;
echo $y; //undefined variable $y.
since you are printing this with echo you will see nothing var_dump($y); // same error , undefined variable $y 
but , data type NULL.

isset($y) ; false --> valid ---> $y does not exist at all --> $y is given memory.


$z=null; //$z -->momory is allocated
echo $z; //no error --> no output will be generated
var_dump($z); // NULL without any error
isset($z); // false here $z is allocated into memory without any value.


unset($y); //deletes from the memory
echo $y;
unset($z); //deletes from the memory
echo $z; undefined variable $z;

var_dump($y); //undefined variable ---NULL
var_dump($z); //no error -->null
unset($y);
 unset($z);
 var_dump($z);//undefined variable --->null
 var_dump($y); //undefined variable --->null
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <?php
 $conn = mysqli_connect('localhost:3308','root','','');
 var_dump($conn); #object --->resource
 ?>
 
 
 
 <?php 
// wap in php to show , object using class_alias
class student{
	private $name='Awnish';
	private $class='Btech';
	private $rollno=1001;
	private $wife="KATRINA";
	private $enemy='VICKY KAUSHAL';
	private $friend='SALMAN';
	
}
$std=new student();
var_dump($std); //user defined---->type resource
	
?>


SUPER GLOBAL VARIABLE:- these are special with global context , and scope and these predefined variable by php and it
has been reserved , for some special purpose.

SUPER Global variables are of two types:-
1. Mangled Super Global variable.
2. Non-Mangled Super Global variable.


Super Global variables in Generals
$GLOBALS: NON-Mangled
$_SERVER :Mangled
$_GET: Mangled
$_POST:Mangled
$_FILES:Mangled
$_COOKIES: Mangled
$_SESSION:Mangled
$_REQUEST:Mangled
$_ENV:Mangled


OTHER SUPER GLOBAL VARIABLES:-
$http_response_header :non-mangled
$argc : non-mangled
$argv : non-mangled
$php_errormsg : Deprecated

Note :: Mangled: which with $ and _ as prefixed
this naming convention is called name mangaling same thing is valid in python :__name__,__main__,__init(self)__init
in javascript : __proto__


1.Mangled Super Global Variable : are the variable whose naming convention is such that , they are declared 
using $ but have _at prefix.
for eg. : normal variable $name , $class, $_SERVER, $_REQUEST, $_GET, $_POST

2.Non-Mangled Super global variable: are the variable whose naming convention are like normal variables and 
use no special prefixing like_or__ they can be treated as normal in case naming convention only.
for eg. $name, $class, $marks, $GLOBALS, $argc, $hhtp_response_header, $php_errormsg

what is different b/w normal variable and super global variable:-
1.SGV, are predefined but normal variable are used defined.
2.SGV, have global scope and normal variable have local scope.
3.normal variable do not have concept of name mangaling but super global variable have.



$GLOBALS: both SAPI(CGI+CLI)
$_SERVER : both SAPI(CGI+CLI) but envirnoment dependent.
$_GET: SAPI :CGI
$_POST: SAPI : CGI
$_FILES:SAPI : CGI
$_COOKIES:SAPI : CGI
$_SESSION: SAPI : CGI
$_REQUEST:SAPI : CGI
$_ENV:SAPI : CGI | CLI


OTHER SUPER GLOBAL VARIABLES:-
$http_response_header : SAPI : CGI
$argc :  CLI
$argv :  CLI
$php_errormsg : BOTH | CGI |CLI

what is SAPI?
1. SAPI stands for server/system application programming interface. it is, a type of service, which 
recognises the envirnoment in which execution of the program take place.
This service is, handled by web-server.

wap in php to show sapi name at diffrent envirnoment .
ans :consider sapi.php

<?php

echo php_sapi_name();
?>

1. php sapi.php//cli
2. php -S localhost:8000//cli-server
3. apache(laragon)--->http://localhost:786/  //apache2handler

1. what is sapi of $name='RAVI'; ?
 a)cli
 b)cgi
 c)both(correct)
 d)this is not super-global variable
 
 2.what is the correct value for $argc when you are running it at url:
 http://localhost:786/p1.php?
 1) 1
 2)2
 3) 0 (correct)
 4) 3
 
 
 Command line Argument in php:-
 ****************************
 In any programming, language  there are two types of inputs envirnoment .
 1.RUNTIME INPUT: inputs are argument supplied during program execution is called as , runtime argument.
 for example: scanf(), getch(), getc(), getchar()
 
 you can take input from these function , or you can supply the input , in these only when program is running 
 in primary memory.
 2. COMPILE TIME, INPUT OR ARGUMENTS:
 the arguments supplied  at compile time of the program is called command line arguments.
 in php we have two super global variable for this.
 1.$argc: argument count
 2.$argv : argument vector and argument variable.
 3. they will under, only sapi mode = cli.
